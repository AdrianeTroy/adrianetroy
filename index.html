          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Adriane Troy U. Alariao but you can just call me Troy. I live in the Philippines on the west side Island of Palawan Province. I live with my Mother and Sister ever since I was a kid and I've had fascination towards technology and the likes. During school, I check my school stuff if there are anything that needs to be done as soon as possible, I compile them in one single folder for convenience. When I'm done with my schoolworks I start doing something productive like digital art and track mixing or video editing, I'm an amateur so I tend to ask people for inputs and opinions to better myself while keeping my own style at the same time. I will present some samples below:
          </p>

            The first video that I've made is a Track I mixed back in 1st year College in the library <br> <b><em>Here is the video:</em></b>
