          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Adriane Troy U. Alariao but you can just call me Troy. I usually spend most of my time everyday doing chores, after I'm done cleaning I head to my room to rest, sitting in front of my desk and play some random YouTube video or listen to music. After resting I check my school stuff if there are anything that needs to be done as soon as possible, I compile them in one single folder for convenience. When I'm done with my schoolworks I start doing something productive like digital art and track mixing, I'm an amateur at both so I tend to ask people for inputs and opinions to better myself while keeping my own style at the same time. I will present some samples below:
          </p>
        <h2>Sample Videos on YouTube</h2>
          <p>
            The first video that I've made is a Track I mixed back in 1st year College in the library <br> <b><em>Here is the video:</em></b>

        <h2>More of my hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            Taking a rest is my favorite thing to do after using my energy. During my rest I listen to music or watch random videos.<br>I will list some of my favorite artists and their tracks which are my most favorite.

            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
              <p>
                My hobbies include track mixing and digital art. In track mixing, I use FL Studio while in digital art, I use Photoshop. I don't have a pentab so I use a mouse to draw using the pen tool. In track mixing, I just make whatever sounds good but I ask my friends for opinion and guidance since I'm an amateur.<br><br><b><em>Here is an example of the recent track that I made:</em></b>
              </p>

                  I'm an amateur at drawing but I do my best and get inspiration from experts when I get motivated enough. What matters is that you felt satisfied finishing your work.
